Intro - Live Conor

Hello, I'm Conor Flynn an engineer in the Dublin office and along with my colleague Adam Barnes we're Team TLOM.
<pause>
So we know we have lots of customers at Toast, and lots of restaurants and they place lots of orders and we thought it would be cool if there was
a way to see the orders coming in in real time.
So for our hack we've put together... Toast Live Orders Map
Here is a short video of the Orders Map in action

Voiceover - Adam

Here we can see the Toast Live Orders Map. The way it works is once a second it queries the server we've created to get the latest order placed at a toast Restaurant.
We're actually using production data from a couple of days ago rather than *live* data but these are real toast orders
A pin with the Toast logo is placed on the map in the correct place using the address data stored in toast-orders and
the colour of the pin varies based on the order amount. Less than 8 dollars gets a bronze pin, 8 to 15 gets silver and any order over 15 dollars gets
a gold pin with a dollar sign inside the Toast logo
Currently it's set to just show 5 pins with the oldest disappearing when a new one comes in, this can be changed in the top right <change the setting>
You can also see there's a text feed on the right showing order amount, number of guests and restaurant name and this can be toggled with the sidebar control <use control>
And the map then expands to fill the whole screen
<pause>
So, what's this for?
Some possible uses:
1) Maybe have it on the toasttab.com website to impress potential customers
2) Have it up on a screen somewhere in the Toast office, maybe behind reception to show visitors to the office
3) Trade shows - something like the National Restaurant Association Show, have it on a big screen at our stall to demonstrate Toast being used across the country

So there it is Toast Live Orders Map, thank you very much


Conor

Goodbye
